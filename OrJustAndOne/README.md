# OrJustAndOne

Here you have some utility methods for integers. There's a subtle flaw. Can you find it?

You could import this into your IDE of choice, but it's easier to just compile and run like this:
```
mkdir bin
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/orjustandone/*.java
java -cp bin orjustandone.Main
```

Good luck!
